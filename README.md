# Analyzing-International-Debt-Statistics

This project uses data provided by The World Bank that contains national and regional debt statistics for several countries across the globe as recorded from 1970 to 2015.
Using this data, I used SQL to answer questions like:
  What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
  Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
  What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?
